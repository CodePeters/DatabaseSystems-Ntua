## Password 
> In the file DatabaseSystems-Ntua/Project/database-SQL/creds_db.sql we use a seperate datavase for login, the username is George and the password is also George as you can see in the line:

> insert into credentials values(1, 'George', 'c654d0a09166bdbc3632d006c92b09a09574666e');

>You can easile set a new username, for password you need to store the sha1 encyption of the password in the database as above (we didn't store George as a password but the sha1 of this word...).
